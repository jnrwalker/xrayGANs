# xrayGANs

This repository will be continually updated as I progress through my master's project, titled: "Improving Intelligent Classification of Pneumonia using Adversarial Augmentation Strategies"

To run all versions of this repository in the future, make sure you have installed the following dependency versions:

- PyTorch==1.13.1
- Torchvision==0.14.1 

In so far, in the first notebook "preprocessing.ipynb" contains the image preprocessing pipleine which I used to preprocess all pneumonia xray images. The two important preprocessing steps are: (1) Histogram equalization and (2) Gaussian blurring
